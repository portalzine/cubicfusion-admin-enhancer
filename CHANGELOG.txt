#### 0.1 - 08.05.2020
1. **Initial Release**   
Admin Enhancer is a work in progress.I am using this WordPress plugin to centralise things I love & need, when sending out a finished website or project.
These tools are completely free and will always stay free.

2. **Shortcode Addon (0.1)**    
All dashboard widgets are converted to simple shortcodes. You can use those shortcodes within Elementor Pro or any other page builder that allows you to create custom admin dashboards. Makes it easy to build white-label dashboards, while still reusing all those nice dashboard widgets.
